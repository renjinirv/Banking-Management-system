# Banking-Management-system
Here I have created a Python program to replicate a bank management system. I have used Functions and data structures to complete this program. At first it was a little bit complicated but after creating the program I was so excited to check for the output.
Here the operations include account creation, account login, deposit amount, withdrawal amount, balance checking and account details checking. Hope you all understand my program very easily.
